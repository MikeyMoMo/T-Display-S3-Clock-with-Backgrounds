This build is a little complicated.  Please follow these steps, in order, and don't get in a rush.

1. Upgrade to ESP32 board level 3.1.3 or higher.

2. You will need to upload in LittleFS format.  To do that, install a new esp32fs.jar file from here: 
   https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-littlefs-arduino-ide/

3. Set your dark hours.  Look for DARK_START and DARK_END.  These are defaults and can be overridden by
   pressing the buttons to turn the display on during any of these hours.  You can also change the brightness for other hours of
   the day or night and the setting will be remembered for the same hour every day.

4. Compile, load and run the program.  No pictures are loaded yet.  It will find no pix and use only the three built-in 
   graphics backgrounds, red, green and blue until pix are loaded.

5. The first time it is run, it might take a while to get around to making a display.
   During this time, it is formatting the spiffs/littlefs partition to accept the LittleFS background pictures.
   You can turn on the Serial Monitor and watch the error message repeat every 0 to 5ms for 
   the entire time it is formatting the spiffs area.

6. When you get a display, close the Serial Monitor window.  It interferes with the pictures upload.  They forgot to disable
   the Serial Monitor window.  It is done during compile but not during file uploading.  That's a bug!

7. Select Tools>ESP32 Sketch Data Upload from the menu, then select LittleFS and press OK.  It will create a compressed file and
   send it to the spiffs partition on the board.  When done, it will reboot, all by itself, start working normally.

8. The partition definitions file MUST be named "partitions.csv" or it will be ignored.  Don't change the name.  I could not find any
   documentation that specifies that requirement but it is required.  It must be in the sketch folder.  The alternative is to edit
   the boards.txt file but is messy and it means that any time you upgrade or reinstall, you will lose that change.  Better to just
   put it in the sketch folder and be done with it.

9. If you choose to add pictures, create them at 320x170 (w x h) pixels and save then in the data folder.  Then add them to the
   routine named "BuildAndShow".  Be sure to keep the sequence of the numbers in the Switch statement.  As of this writing, there are
   119 pictures so the next one should be 120.  The format of the call to SetPic_Colors is:
   
      first parm: Color of the time characters
   
      second parm: Color of the data characters
   
      third parm: Color of the backlight characters (only on screen while changing the brightness of the screen)
   
      fourth parm: true or false.  If true, add a darkening screen behind the time characters to lower the brightness of the
      background.
   
      fifth parm: true or false.  If true, add a darkening screen behind the date characters to lower the brightness of the
      background.
   
   Yeah, I know the order is messed up but that's how it evolved.  Lots of busywork to fix it.  May do or may not do...

10. The files are normal .jpg files.  You do not have to create bitmaps for them.  Just copy your picture into the data file.  Thank
    the creator of the jpg library for giving us an easy way to get jpg's onto the screen without having to turn them into hex code!
    Also thanks for enabling pulling them from the data partition rather than SD card.  Made the project a lot easier!
